#  Before and after fermentation: parameters of must and wine

(Input adj. to graphs!!!) --> added some missing data; 

Dataset from the internship of a student from the faculty of Enology and Viticulture in Trento. The student's request for help mentioned to yours truly, 
was to categorize a series of laboratoria samples of grape berries, from about sixty experimental daughter plants, born from the crossing of two parent plants,
carefully selected for the experiment, according to certain genetic traits such as skin or berry flesh. 
Following categorization, we wanted to obtain a graphical representation of the distribution of biological parameters of must and wine, then before 
and after fermentation. Collaborating with such a student (a good friend of mine), I provided technical support, thanks to my data analysis skills using python, in the whole procedure, ensuring the result shown here. This result was approved and will be used in the thesis of said student. The satisfaction of having created something useful 
to someone, starting from scratch, as me an economics student with no computer science skills, is great. I hope in the future to collaborate again in the area of research ;).
